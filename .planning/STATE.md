# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-04)

**Core value:** Full terminal experience remotely - if it works in iTerm2, it should work in the browser
**Current focus:** Phase 3 - Performance & Reliability

## Current Position

Phase: 3 of 3 (Performance & Reliability)
Plan: 0 of ? in current phase
Status: Not started
Last activity: 2026-02-05 - Completed Phase 2

Progress: [########=-] 89%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 8
- Average duration: 4 min
- Total execution time: ~0.5 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Connection & Auth | 3 | 14 min | 5 min |
| 2. Terminal & iTerm2 | 5 | 20 min | 4 min |
| 3. Performance | - | - | - |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

| Decision | Rationale | Plan |
|----------|-----------|------|
| 6-char session codes with nolookalikes alphabet | Balance human-typeable and collision-resistant (~1B combinations) | 01-01 |
| 5-minute code expiry, infinite once paired | Codes expire unused but last forever once connected | 01-01 |
| Zod discriminated unions for protocol | Compile-time + runtime safety for WebSocket messages | 01-01 |
| State machine for connection lifecycle | Validates transitions, prevents invalid state jumps | 01-02 |
| Exponential backoff 1s/2x/30s max with 10% jitter | Balance quick recovery with server protection | 01-02 |
| Svelte 5 runes for reactive state | Modern reactive patterns with $state/$derived/$effect | 01-03 |
| reconnecting-websocket for auto-reconnect | Exponential backoff 1s-30s, max 10 retries | 01-03 |
| Default passthrough routing in relay | All new message types are pure relay - Zod validates, forward raw JSON | 02-01 |
| JSON lines over Unix domain socket for IPC | Simple, debuggable protocol for Python-to-Node.js bridge communication | 02-02 |
| One coprocess socket per session | Avoids multiplexing complexity in coprocess shell script | 02-02 |
| Base64 encoding for terminal data | Raw PTY bytes may contain non-UTF-8, safe for JSON transport | 02-02 |
| fileURLToPath for ESM dirname | tsconfig bundler moduleResolution lacks import.meta.dirname types | 02-03 |
| Import addon types from xterm-svelte re-exports | pnpm virtual store prevents direct @xterm/* type imports | 02-04 |
| Terminal.svelte exports write/getTerminal/fit | Store needs to write data to specific terminal instances | 02-04 |
| Sticky modifiers for mobile control bar | Tap-once Ctrl/Alt for better touch UX | 02-05 |
| SSR disabled globally | SvelteKit 2.50 + Svelte 5 + Vite 6 CSS bug; terminal app has no SSR benefit | 02-05 fix |
| Python venv for mac-client deps | macOS Homebrew Python blocks pip install (PEP 668) | 02-05 fix |
| .svelte.ts for rune-enabled stores | Svelte 5 $state only available in .svelte and .svelte.ts files | 02-05 fix |

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- socat not installed on system; coprocess script falls back to nc. Recommend `brew install socat` for production use.
- iTerm2 resize: Mac bridge receives resize messages but doesn't resize iTerm2 PTY (design limitation — iTerm2 controls PTY size based on session display area).
